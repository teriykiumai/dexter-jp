# Dexter JP — Autonomous Research Agent for Japanese Equities

> Ask a question. It plans the research, combines authoritative sources with deterministic analysis engines, and delivers a report that states both evidence and limitations.

A financial AI agent built for the Japanese stock market, powered by [EDINET DB](https://edinetdb.com) + [J-Quants](https://jpx-jquants.com/).
Forked from [virattt/dexter](https://github.com/virattt/dexter) (US equities) and rebuilt from the ground up for Japan.

Dexter JP is personal, local research software. It does not provide investment advice, place broker orders, or trade automatically. Unavailable data is never replaced with zero or an invented value.

## Not Just Another Financial Tool

Most financial tools stop at "here's a screener" or "here's the data." Dexter JP goes further.

**Ask: "Compare Sony and Nintendo using financial, valuation, and risk evidence"** and it will:

1. Build a plan — decide which metrics matter (profitability, growth, balance sheet strength, risk) on its own
2. Call multiple tools autonomously — pull financial statements, annual report risk factors, and earnings summaries for both companies in parallel
3. Self-validate mid-process — check whether the numbers and narrative are consistent, and whether it has enough data
4. Deliver a report — output a structured analysis with comparison tables, conditional scenarios, and risks

One question, zero human intervention. This is not single-tool data retrieval. It is multi-source, autonomous analysis.

## Current Analysis Capabilities

- Fundamental / Valuation / Peer Comparison
- Technical analysis with SMA, ATR, swings, trend, RSI14, MACD, and Bollinger Bands
- Margin Supply & Demand and public short-position disclosures
- Investor-type market flows, TOPIX / TSE 33-sector comparison, and sector short-selling turnover
- Advanced Dividend context covering actuals, company forecasts, payout ratios, and available dividend events
- Daily-OHLCV estimated Volume Profile with POC, VAH, and VAL
- Deterministic Entry / Stop / Target candidates only when their required source inputs exist
- Canonical AnalysisSnapshot V9, analysis history, a local Dashboard, and an Analysis Watchlist

Important financial and statistical calculations run in deterministic TypeScript engines; the AI interprets structured results. Volume Profile is an estimate derived from daily OHLCV, not actual investor cost basis or true retained overhead supply. POC / VAH / VAL are not automatic trading signals.

## Setup

### Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- An LLM API key (at least one of the options below)
- An [EDINET DB](https://edinetdb.com) API key

Configure J-Quants to enable market-data analysis such as prices, Technical, supply and demand, market/sector comparisons, short selling, investor types, dividends, and Volume Profile. Endpoint access and history depend on the configured plan and current data availability.

### Environment Variables

Set these in your `.env` file:

```bash
# === Required ===

# LLM (at least one; you can set multiple and switch between them in the CLI)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...          # OpenAI (default)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...   # Claude
GOOGLE_API_KEY=...             # Gemini
XAI_API_KEY=...                # Grok
MOONSHOT_API_KEY=...           # Kimi
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=...           # DeepSeek
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...         # OpenRouter (access to multiple models)

# Japanese equity data

# === Optional ===

# Japanese market data (coverage depends on the J-Quants plan)
JQUANTS_API_KEY=...            # Get yours at jpx-jquants.com

# Web search (enables web_search and provider selection in the CLI)
EXASEARCH_API_KEY=...
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=...
TAVILY_API_KEY=...
LANGSEARCH_API_KEY=...

# X/Twitter search
X_BEARER_TOKEN=...

# Local LLM
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434
```

### Install & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/teriykiumai/dexter-jp.git
cd dexter-jp
bun install
cp env.example .env  # Edit this file and add your API keys
bun run start
```

See the [Usage Guide](Usage.md) for detailed operation, Snapshot compatibility, the Dashboard, data dates, and unavailable-data semantics.

## Usage Examples

### Autonomous Analysis (Where the Agent Shines)

Throw a complex question at Dexter and it will plan, gather data across multiple sources, and produce a report:

```
Comprehensive analysis of Toyota's competitiveness. Cover financials, risk factors from the annual report, and latest earnings — compile everything into a report.

Compare Sony and Nintendo using financial health, profitability, growth, and risk. Explain the strengths and conditional scenarios.

Find undervalued stocks with high ROE and high dividends, then deep-dive into the top 3 on balance sheet strength and business risk.

Run a DCF valuation on Keyence. Show the assumptions and the gap to the current price.
```

### Simple Queries Work Too

```
Show me Toyota's financial trends over the last 5 years.

Screen for companies with ROE above 15% and equity ratio above 50%.

Pull the risk factors section from Nintendo's annual securities report.

Find high-dividend stocks yielding above 4%.
```

### Works in English

```
Analyze Toyota's competitiveness. Cover financials, risk factors from the annual report, and latest earnings.

Compare Sony and Nintendo using financial health, profitability, growth, and risk evidence. State the conditions behind the conclusion.
```

## Snapshot and Local Dashboard

A Standard Agent comprehensive analysis builds a Canonical AnalysisSnapshot from structured source and Engine results, then saves latest and historical files under `.dexter/analysis/`. V9 is the current writer; existing V1-V8 history remains readable and immutable.

```bash
bun run dashboard
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3000/` to view the Analysis Watchlist, latest analyses, history, and the Single Stock Dashboard. The Dashboard is a presentation layer over Snapshot values and does not recalculate financial metrics in the browser. Snapshot generation currently applies to Standard Agent runs; Claude Agent SDK mode is not connected to that path.

## Architecture

```

### How the Meta-Tool Works

`get_financials` is not a simple API wrapper. It is a **routing agent** with its own internal LLM:

1. Receives a natural language query from the user
2. Its internal LLM decides which sub-tools to invoke
3. Runs multiple sub-tools in parallel
4. Consolidates results and returns them

"Compare Sony and Toyota's profit margins" triggers four API calls behind the scenes, automatically.

### Skills System

Complex multi-step workflows are defined in `SKILL.md` files. Ships with a built-in DCF valuation skill:
- WACC calculation based on Japanese government bond yields
- Awareness of TSE's PBR-below-1x governance push
- All analysis in JPY

### Research Rules (`.dexter/RULES.md`)

Define your investment style and analysis preferences in Markdown. The rules are automatically loaded into the system prompt and guide Dexter's research behavior.

```bash
mkdir -p .dexter
cp RULES.md.example .dexter/RULES.md
# Edit to match your preferences
```

Use `/rules` in the CLI to verify your current rules are active.

Examples:
- Always compare against 5 sector peers
- Report financials in JPY millions
- Screen using value criteria (ROE > 10%, PBR < 1.5)

### Context Compaction

During long research sessions with heavy data retrieval, a fast LLM automatically compresses accumulated tool results into a structured summary. Unlike simple clearing, key numbers and conclusions are preserved — keeping analysis coherent across the full session.

### Memory

Persists across sessions. Dexter remembers your investment thesis, portfolio information, and past analyses.

### Supported LLMs

Switch providers with `/model`. The current provider registry includes OpenAI,
Anthropic, Google, xAI, Moonshot, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Ollama, and Claude Agent SDK.
Individual model availability can change at the provider, so use the current choices
shown by the CLI.

### Claude Agent SDK mode

A run mode powered by `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`. The agent loop is delegated to the SDK, and **authentication is resolved by the SDK** — Dexter implements no auth flow of its own.

- Pick the **Claude Agent SDK** provider via `/model`, choose a model (claude-fable-5 / claude-opus-4-8 / claude-sonnet-4-6), and go. No API key entry is requested.
- The SDK resolves credentials. It works with your **Claude Code login**, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — the SDK decides which, based on your environment.
- Whether the Agent SDK can be used on a Claude plan (Pro/Max), and under what terms, is described in Anthropic's help ([Use the Claude Agent SDK with your Claude plan](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/15036540)). Terms may change.
- Use it with your own personal credentials only; do not offer it as a multi-user service.
- **Billing-path check**: if a usage-based credential (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX`, …) is present in the environment, the mode reports what it detected at startup and stops before running so it does not proceed on an unintended billing path (fail-loud). To proceed on that path, set `DEXTER_AGENT_SDK_ALLOW_METERED=1` and retry.
- To cap cost, set `DEXTER_AGENT_SDK_MAX_BUDGET_USD` (USD); the SDK stops when its estimate reaches it.
- In this mode Dexter's finance/data tools return raw data for the main model to interpret (no internal LLM re-call inside tools). SDK built-in tools (Bash / Write / WebSearch, etc.) are not used.

> Note: availability and pricing of this mode depend on Anthropic's terms and may change. This does not claim the mode is "free" or "no extra cost"; the startup line shows which credential path is actually in use.

### Messaging Integrations

Use Dexter beyond the CLI — connect it to Slack, Discord, or LINE. Start with `bun run gateway`:

| Channel | Protocol | Public URL Required? | Environment Variables |
|---------|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Slack** | Socket Mode (WebSocket) | No | `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` + `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` |
| **Discord** | Gateway (WebSocket) | No | `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` |
| **LINE** | Webhook (HTTP) | Yes | `LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET` + `LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN` |
| WhatsApp | Baileys (WebSocket) | No | QR code login |

Only channels with configured environment variables will start. Multiple channels can run simultaneously.

#### Slack Bot Setup

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) -> **Create New App** -> From scratch
2. **Socket Mode** -> Enable -> Generate an App-Level Token (starts with `xapp-`)
3. **OAuth & Permissions** -> Add Bot Token Scopes:
   - `chat:write`, `im:history`, `im:read`, `app_mentions:read`
4. **Event Subscriptions** -> Enable Events -> Subscribe to bot events:
   - `message.im` (DM), `app_mention` (mentions)
5. **App Home** -> Turn on Messages Tab -> Check "Allow users to send Slash commands and messages from the messages tab"
6. **Install to Workspace** -> Copy the Bot Token (starts with `xoxb-`)
7. Add to `.env`:
   ```bash
   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
   SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-...
   ```

In channels, Dexter replies in threads. In DMs, it replies directly.

#### Discord Bot Setup

1. Go to [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) -> **New Application**
2. **Bot** -> Reset Token -> Copy the Bot Token
3. **Bot** -> Privileged Gateway Intents -> Enable **Message Content Intent**
4. **OAuth2** -> URL Generator:
   - Scopes: `bot`
   - Bot Permissions: `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, `Send Messages in Threads`
5. Open the generated URL in your browser and invite the bot to your server
6. Add to `.env`:
   ```bash
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=MTQ4...
   ```

In servers, mention `@BotName` to get a threaded reply. In DMs, it replies directly.

#### LINE Bot Setup

LINE uses webhooks (not WebSocket), so you need a publicly accessible URL — unlike Slack/Discord.

1. Create a **LINE Official Account** at [LINE Official Account Manager](https://manager.line.biz/)
   - As of 2026, you cannot create Messaging API channels directly from the LINE Developers Console
2. In LINE Official Account Manager → **Settings** → **Messaging API** → **Enable Messaging API**
   - Select an existing provider
3. In [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/) → your channel → **Messaging API** tab:
   - **Channel access token (long-lived)** → Issue
   - **Webhook URL** → `https://{your-domain}/webhook/line`
   - **Use webhook** → ON
   - **Webhook redelivery** → OFF (prevents duplicate processing)
4. In LINE Official Account Manager → **Settings** → **Response settings**:
   - **Auto-reply messages** → OFF
   - **Greeting messages** → OFF
5. Get the Channel Secret from the **Basic settings** tab
6. Add to `.env`:
   ```bash
   LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET=your-channel-secret
   LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-channel-access-token
   WEBHOOK_PORT=3000  # default
   ```

For the public webhook URL:
- **Local testing**: `ngrok http 3000` → use the generated URL + `/webhook/line`
- **Production**: Deploy to any service that supports long-lived processes (not serverless):
  - [Railway](https://railway.app/) — just add a `Dockerfile`. Free tier available. Easiest option
  - [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) — `fly launch` and done. Free tier available
  - [Render](https://render.com/) — run as a Background Worker. Free tier available
  - Google Cloud Run (min-instances=1)
  - Any VPS
  - **Vercel / Netlify won't work** (serverless — can't maintain long-lived processes)

#### Start the Gateway

```bash
bun run gateway    # All configured channels start simultaneously
```
